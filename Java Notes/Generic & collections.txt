Generics in java
----
generics are facility of generic programming

These feature were added to the java programming 
language back in 2004 within version J2SE 5.0


they were designed to extend java's type system to allow a type or method to opearate 
on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety

Generics in java

In Software engineering bugs are simply a fact of life
but some bugs are easier to detect than others
there are two main types of bugs and errors:-
RUN time errors

These errors are problematic 
Don't always surface immediately and it 
may be at a point in the program that is far 
from the actual cause of the problem



Compile time errors


It is easy to detect them
as the application won't compile
compile's errors mesaage help to figure-out
what the problem is:

compile's time error can be fixed easily


Why to Use generics?

generics add stability to your code.

it makes most of the bugs and errors to be detachable at compile-time and not 
at run-time.

We prefer compile time error to run time errors.


Why to use generics?

generics enables types (classes and interface) to be 
parameters when defining classes, interface and methods

we can reuse the same code with differeny inputs
