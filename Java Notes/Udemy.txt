Jshell

From java 9
Java is equally easy to learn -Jshell
Java REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)

Exit from jshell
/exit


Parameter


Escape Charactrer

"\
\n
\t


format specifier

%s


Declaration
Assignment

Java is Strongly typed language



Pascal Case
Camelcase
camelCase
PascalCase



(
	int i=1;
	for(;i<=10;i++);
Empty Statement in for loop
)

literal is numeric value
integer literal
decimal literal


jshell
/methods
/backup.txt
/exit
/edit method
/list method()





compiling and execution
java code--->compiled---->bytecode--->run---->bytecode--->windowsjvm-->windows instruction


class file contains bytecode

class is like template.
multiple instances of class.

class name should match the filename

JVM---> convert bytes code into windows/mac Instructions(Machine Instructions)
JVM runs Java Bytecode
JRE=JVM+Libraries+OtherComponenets(Libraries related to java)
java classes is part of JRE

JDK=JRE+Compilers+Debuggers
all the compilers
develop java program




Object Oriented Programming



Data/State/fields
actions/behaviour/methods/function




Wrapper Class

floating number in java is accurate

character 
Unicode
Unicode character is supported by java
2Byte
Internally character is Number


in calculation don't use float and double data types
Use BigDecimal
---------------
Reference Types in java



Each method has a seprate stack
stack and heap memory

Heap(Global Shared)

Generally primitive data is stored in stack


String is immutable.
concatentation executes from left to right
1+2+"3"===> "33"
"1"+2+3====>"123"

creating object is very very costly

Synchronised Class

StringBuffer (thread safe)
StringBuilder (if u not care about of multithreading)




Wrapper Classes
A wrapper class wraps(encloses) around a data type and gives it an object apperance.
wrapper classes are final and immutable

primitive:boolean,byte,char,double,float,int,long,short
Wrapper:Boolean,Byte,Character,Double,Float,Integer,Long,Short



why wrapper classes?

Auto boxing


JODA Time Framework



LocalDate,LocalDateTime,LocalTime


Show default imports

/imports



Arrays.sort(arr) //InPosition Sorting



--------
variable arguments should be the last arguments
Array List is Part of collections



we can't have two public class in one .java file

Java rule: One Public class in one file

Multiple inheritance is not supported by java.
but it is supported by cpp

Abstract class

Syntatically Abstract and interface both are same.

instead of class keyword we are using interface keyword

Interface
Communication between Two Projects
Interface is Contract
In interface everything is public



Abstarct method can have private


Polymorphism

Samecode different behaviour



Normal array is immutable
Low Level DataStructure
Business Logic



List,Set,Map,Queue

List can have duplicates
