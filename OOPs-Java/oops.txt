Why main  is declared as a static method?

What is static?

We can use main function without creating an object
 of that class (main class).
 
main is very first thing actually which runs whenever we run java programs
 
if main is not there you will not able to run it

main is the first thing we have to run then if yoy do not put it as a static 

//outside classes cannot be static why?


//inner classes can be static
 
 static methods are resolved during compile times.
 class level methods---> statics methods
 
 
 Encapsulation
 
 Wrapping up the implementaion of the data members and methods in class
 
 
 
 
 Abstraction
 
 
 Hiding unnecesary details and sharing valuable information to the user
